## TODO
- [ ] Cross reference dlc files and dlc id's. Incase dlc id's and dlc files differ in terms of quantity it will notify the user.
- [ ] Possibly add functionality to search for dlc files/automatically installing them.
- [ ] Add the possibility to install cream/smokeapi for games running proton.
- [ ] Check if the game already has dlc files installed
- [ ] Gui? (most likely not but ill see what i can do ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
- [ ] Add checker for configs already applied to games. (i.e script will check for new dlc id's for already applied games.)
- [ ] Add a way to check if a game blocks LD_PRELOAD.
- [ ] Update/notifier if creamlinux itself is outdated.

### Issues?
- Open a issue and attach all relevant errors/logs.
